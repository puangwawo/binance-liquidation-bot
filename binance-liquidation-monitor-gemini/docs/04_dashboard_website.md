## Frontend Implementation

### React Application Structure

The React application follows modern development practices with a component-based architecture that promotes reusability and maintainability. The application is structured around a single-page application (SPA) model that provides seamless navigation and real-time data updates.

**Component Hierarchy:**
```
App.jsx (Root Component)
├── Header Component
│   ├── Brand Logo & Title
│   ├── System Status Indicator
│   └── Refresh Controls
├── Alert System
│   ├── Success Alerts
│   └── Error Handling
├── Metrics Dashboard
│   ├── Total Liquidations Card
│   ├── AI Accuracy Card
│   ├── Telegram Delivery Card
│   └── Average Latency Card
├── Tabbed Interface
│   ├── Recent Liquidations Tab
│   ├── Monitored Symbols Tab
│   ├── System Status Tab
│   └── Configuration Tab
└── Footer Component
```

### User Interface Design

The dashboard employs a sophisticated design system that balances functionality with aesthetic appeal. The interface utilizes a gradient background that transitions from light slate tones to create visual depth, while maintaining excellent readability across all components.

**Design Principles:**
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: High contrast ratios and semantic HTML ensure compatibility with screen readers
- **Performance**: Optimized component rendering and lazy loading for fast page loads
- **Consistency**: Unified color scheme and typography throughout the application

**Color Palette:**
- Primary Brand Colors: Blue (#2563eb) to Purple (#7c3aed) gradient
- Status Indicators: Green (#10b981) for success, Red (#ef4444) for errors, Yellow (#f59e0b) for warnings
- Background: Gradient from Slate 50 to Slate 100 in light mode
- Text: High contrast dark slate for optimal readability

### Real-time Data Integration

The frontend implements sophisticated data fetching mechanisms that ensure users always have access to the most current information. The application uses a combination of automatic refresh intervals and manual refresh capabilities to maintain data freshness.

**Data Fetching Strategy:**
- **Initial Load**: Comprehensive data fetch on application startup
- **Auto-refresh**: 30-second intervals for continuous updates
- **Manual Refresh**: User-initiated refresh with loading indicators
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with cached data fallback
- **Loading States**: Smooth transitions with skeleton screens and spinners

The API integration layer abstracts the complexity of data fetching and provides a clean interface for components to consume real-time liquidation data, system metrics, and configuration information.

### Interactive Features
